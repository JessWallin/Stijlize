# Stijlize

Stijlize combines art and data to translate works of art into data visualization reminiscent of de Stijl style artwork.

## Motivation

The de Stijl movement was based on the idea of art as a universal visual langage, much in the same way that data visualization can provide an abstracted visual context to quantifiable data. <br>
Stijlize is also a tool for bringing fine-arts driven color pallettes into your design, allowing you to download pallates as PNG files or JSON objects.
